# social-matching-app
The basic idea is to create a web-application that allows users to signup and enter details about their likes/dislikes, personality type etc. 
Users can then state lists of things they desire in potential dating patners or friends (along with their desired level of importance, on a sliding scale) and a score is generated
from the sum of the importance levels in the intersection between what they desire and is stated in the others lists of likes/dislikes (and other qualities) + the intersection of what they desire and
what is the case in your corresponding lists of information.
